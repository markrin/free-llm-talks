Great question! You're right that Erlang's features—such as fault tolerance, concurrency, and distributed systems design—make it a strong candidate for container orchestration systems, and it's natural to wonder why systems like Kubernetes and their internal databases, such as etcd, don't use Erlang, especially given its well-suited nature for handling distributed systems.

Here are several key reasons why container orchestration systems and internal databases like etcd tend to avoid Erlang in favor of other technologies like Go:

### **1. Ecosystem and Developer Familiarity**
- **Go (and Kubernetes) Ecosystem**: Kubernetes was designed from the ground up with Go, and Go's ecosystem is heavily integrated into the cloud-native landscape. Go is the language of choice for many modern tools in this space (e.g., Docker, gRPC, Helm, etc.). The container ecosystem has grown around Go, and the tooling, libraries, and developer expertise are heavily entrenched in the Go ecosystem.
- **Learning Curve**: Go is relatively easy to learn, especially for developers already familiar with languages like C, Java, or Python. Erlang, on the other hand, has a steep learning curve, especially for teams without a functional programming background. This makes it harder to recruit and retain developers with the specific skills needed for Erlang.

### **2. Performance and Efficiency**
- **Go's Performance**: Go compiles to native machine code, making it highly efficient in terms of raw performance, which is a crucial factor for container orchestration systems. Erlang, while designed for concurrency, can be less performant in CPU-bound tasks due to its virtual machine (the BEAM) and the fact that it relies heavily on message-passing, which can introduce latency in certain scenarios.
- **Etcd's Use of Raft**: Etcd, which uses the **Raft consensus algorithm** for distributed consistency, needs to ensure that its performance is fast and efficient for operations like leader election, committing transactions, and coordinating distributed state. Go’s concurrency model and built-in tools like **goroutines** and **channels** are better suited for the performance requirements and scaling needs of such systems.

### **3. Fault Tolerance and Supervision in Distributed Systems**
- **Erlang’s Fault Isolation**: Erlang's model for fault tolerance and its approach to fault isolation via processes (with the "let it crash" philosophy and supervision trees) is extremely powerful in systems where reliability is paramount. However, while these concepts work beautifully for Erlang, they are **not always a natural fit for every type of distributed system**.
- **Etcd and Go's Fault Tolerance**: Go does not natively have the kind of process isolation and supervision trees that Erlang provides. However, **etcd's architecture** does implement its own fault tolerance mechanisms, like leader election and **replication** through Raft, and it is designed to be highly resilient. Go’s error-handling model (explicit error checks and retries) works well in this context.
  - Additionally, Go's approach to concurrency (using goroutines and channels) provides a simpler, less complex way to manage concurrency in container orchestration systems compared to Erlang’s message-passing model, which requires more intricate design patterns.

### **4. Containerized Ecosystem and Distributed State**
- **Kubernetes and Go’s Concurrency**: Kubernetes has to manage large-scale, dynamic clusters of containers. Go’s concurrency model is particularly well-suited for tasks like handling thousands of HTTP requests (via the Kubernetes API server) and coordinating many concurrent processes (like scheduling and managing pods). Go’s **goroutines** and **channels** make these types of tasks more straightforward to implement and manage compared to Erlang’s actor model.
- **Distributed Databases (Etcd)**: Etcd, which underpins Kubernetes' state store, is designed for **strong consistency** and **fault tolerance** using Raft, which can be implemented efficiently in Go. Erlang could potentially be used for this as well, but again, the performance and ecosystem benefits of Go, combined with the fact that it’s **more easily integrable into modern containerized environments**, make it a preferred choice.

### **5. Tooling, Libraries, and Integration**
- **Go’s Ecosystem in Cloud-Native Tools**: The cloud-native ecosystem (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.) is dominated by Go, and this has led to a vast amount of tooling, libraries, and documentation available to developers. This vast ecosystem simplifies integration, debugging, and scaling systems built with Kubernetes and Go.
  - **Erlang's Ecosystem**: While Erlang's ecosystem for building distributed systems is strong (e.g., **RabbitMQ**, **CouchDB**, **Ejabberd**), it does not have the same level of widespread use in the container orchestration space. This makes it harder to find tools and libraries tailored for the specific needs of container orchestration systems, particularly when dealing with things like resource scheduling, service discovery, and container networking.

### **6. Raft and Consensus Algorithms**
- **Raft in Go (Etcd)**: Etcd, the key-value store used by Kubernetes, uses the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure consistency across distributed systems. The **Raft algorithm** is relatively straightforward to implement in Go, with many well-documented Go libraries available. While Erlang could also implement Raft, Go’s ecosystem and the existing consensus algorithms in Go are already well-optimized and integrated into the Kubernetes and cloud-native stack.
  - **Erlang's Actor Model vs. Raft**: The actor model in Erlang is designed for managing concurrency and stateful processes, not necessarily for implementing a distributed consensus algorithm like Raft. Go's approach (using goroutines and channels) aligns better with the design patterns typically seen in distributed consensus systems like Raft.

### **7. Reliability in Highly Dynamic Systems**
- **Container Orchestration**: Container orchestration involves highly dynamic environments with containers being spun up and down, and state constantly changing. Go’s concurrency model and **go-routines** are better suited for the types of dynamic, lightweight tasks that are characteristic of cloud-native environments. In contrast, Erlang’s processes are great for long-running, stateful applications but can be a bit heavy for the frequent creation and destruction of processes that occur in container orchestration.

### **Conclusion**
While **Erlang** is a fantastic choice for certain distributed systems, especially those requiring massive concurrency, fault isolation, and long-lived, reliable processes (e.g., telecom, messaging systems, real-time systems), the **container orchestration landscape** (Kubernetes, etcd, Docker) has developed around a different set of needs and technologies. 

The key factors for using **Go** in this space are:
- **Performance** (especially for high-throughput tasks like API handling and container scheduling).
- **Developer familiarity** (Go is simpler for most developers, and its ecosystem is deeply integrated with cloud-native tools).
- **Concurrency** (Go’s goroutines are very well suited for dynamic and high-performance systems).
- **Ecosystem** (Go’s rich ecosystem and libraries for building distributed systems like Raft, Kubernetes, and etcd).

Erlang certainly excels in specific areas like **fault tolerance**, **message-passing**, and **concurrency**, but **Go's performance**, **simplicity**, and the existing **cloud-native ecosystem** make it a more pragmatic choice for container orchestration and related systems.
